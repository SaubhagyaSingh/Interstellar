      To infinity and beyond goes “Interstellar,” an exhilarating slalom through
      the wormholes of Christopher Nolan’s vast imagination that is at once a
      science-geek fever dream and a formidable consideration of what makes us
      human. We begin somewhere in the American farm belt, which Nolan evokes
      for its full mythic grandeur — blazing sunlight, towering corn stalks,
      whirring combines. But it soon becomes clear that this would-be field of
      dreams is something closer to a nightmare. The date is an unspecified
      point in the near future, close enough to look and feel like tomorrow, yet
      far enough for a number of radical changes to have taken hold in society.
      A decade on from a period of widespread famine, the world’s armies have
      been disbanded and the cutting-edge technocracies of the early 21st
      century have regressed into more utilitarian, farm-based economies. <br />
      <b
        >“We used to look up in the sky and wonder about our place in the
        stars,” Cooper muses. “Now we just look down and wonder about our place
        in the dirt.”</b
      >
      This line is my personal favorite :) <br />
      In Earth's future, a global crop blight and second Dust Bowl are slowly
      rendering the planet uninhabitable. Professor Brand (Michael Caine), a
      brilliant NASA physicist, is working on plans to save mankind by
      transporting Earth's population to a new home via a wormhole. But first,
      Brand must send former NASA pilot Cooper (Matthew McConaughey) and a team
      of researchers through the wormhole and across the galaxy to find out
      which of three planets could be mankind's new home.
      <br />
      The whole story revolves around two plans in the Interstellar plot:

      <li>
        Plan A involves Cooper transmitting quantum data back to Earth in order
        to develop a gravitational propulsion theory that will allow spacecrafts
        to carry people off Earth into the other galaxy.
      </li>
      <br />

      <li>
        Plan B involves Cooper’s crew finding the remaining Lazarus crew and
        establishing a colony on another world.
      </li>
      <h2 class="header2">Water Planet</h2>
      <img src="water.webp" alt="" />
      <p>
        The Endurance crew decides to scout out Miller’s planet because it was
        the one that had most recently transmitted data to them. But since the
        planet is so close to the black hole, time is extremely dilated — every
        hour on the water planet is equivalent to seven years on Earth. Cooper,
        Brand (Anne Hathaway), and Doyle (Wes Bentley) land on the surface and
        attempt to locate Miller’s transponder. But just as Brand finds the
        device, a massive wave rolls in, forcing the crew to flee to the courier
        ship. Doyle dies but Cooper and Brand narrowly escape — and Brand
        realizes that Miller must’ve died seconds before they arrived because of
        the severe time dilation.
      </p>
      Matt Damon plays the role of Dr. Mann, the captain of the Lazarus mission.
      After the failure of the water planet mission, Cooper is left with a
      difficult choice – go to Dr. Edmunds’ planet or Dr. Mann’s planet.
      <h2 class="header2">Choice</h2>
      <img src="Mann.webp" alt="" />
      <p>
        Cooper chooses Mann’s planet, taking the Endurance on a one-way trip to
        Matt Damon Town. When the crew arrives, they find Mann in cryosleep.
        It’s pretty much clear from the get-go that something is wrong with Mann
        – although considering the fact that he’s been in solitude/cryosleep for
        years, it’s not hard to see why. But Mann has more than just a case of
        cabin fever, he’s full-blown bent on finishing the mission, no matter
        the cost.
      </p>
      Back on Earth, Dr. Brand reveals to Murph that Plan A was always a sham
      and there’s no way the people of Earth could ever escape.
      <br />
      Murph transmits a message to Cooper accusing him of knowing Plan A wasn’t
      possible, effectively leaving her to die. Cooper tells Mann, Brand and
      Romilly that he’s going to return to Earth to be with his children and the
      rest of them can stay on Mann’s planet to start a colony. But Mann’s
      planet isn’t hospitable – and he needs the ship to go to Edmunds’ planet.
      In this scene, Nolan intercuts between Cooper’s confrontation with Mann
      and Murph’s confrontation with Tom. Murph burns all of the crops in order
      to make Tom understand he needs to leave the farm. Romilly is killed by a
      trap mine. Brand and Cooper barely escape back to the Endurance.
      <h2 class="header2">Ending Explained</h2>
      How does Interstellar end? In order to save Brand, Cooper slingshots
      around Gargantua to generate enough energy to send the Endurance to
      Edmunds’ planet. As a result, he slips into the black hole and beyond the
      event horizon. There, he finds himself trapped in the fourth dimension – a
      tesseract styled as a never-ending bookshelf. But Cooper realizes that
      he’s able to interact with Murph through spacetime. He asks TARS to relay
      the quantum data to him, which he communicates through morse code. Murph
      picks up on the morse code because she was fascinated by the gravitational
      anomalies in their house ever since she was a kid. Turns out, those
      anomalies were caused by Cooper interacting through another dimension –
      sending himself on a mission to get the quantum data. Don’t just take my
      word for it – for more on the Interstellar ending explained, let’s listen
      to Neil deGrasse Tyson.

    <h2 class="header2">Scientific Accuracy:</h2>
    <p class="intro">
      At the heart of every galaxy lies a supermassive black hole, where gravity
      is so strong that nothing - not even light - can escape its boundary.<br />

      In the movie "Interstellar," a fictional black hole called Gargantua takes
      center stage. The film came out exactly five years ago, in November 2014.
      In it, Matthew McConaughey and Anne Hathaway play astronauts who travel
      through a wormhole - a tunnel that allows for nearly instantaneous travel
      between far-distant points - to explore three planets that orbit
      Gargantua, 10 billion light-years from Earth.<br />

      In the end, McConaughey's character navigates his ship into the
      supermassive black hole, inside which he discovers a fifth dimension,
      inter-dimensional omniscient beings, and the ability to communicate with
      his estranged daughter across time and space.<br /><br />

      Director Christopher Nolan and his visual effects team strove for superior
      scientific accuracy in "Interstellar" - they even hired theoretical
      physicist and Nobel laureate Kip Thorne as a consultant.<br />
      "Neither wormholes nor black holes have been depicted in any Hollywood
      movie in the way that they actually would appear," Thorne said in an
      interview prior to the movie's release. "This is the first time the
      depiction began with Einstein's general relativity equations." Indeed, the
      movie's depiction of Gargantua was lauded as the most accurate film
      portrayal of a black hole ever.
      <br />
      But in the last five years, a handful of major discoveries about black
      holes have given physicists new insights about what these massive objects
      look like and how they behave. Based on that information, Gargantua wasn't
      completely accurate, though it still comes close in many respects. Here's
      what "Interstellar" got right and wrong.
      <img src="bl.webp" alt="" style="width: 50%" />
    </p>
    <p class="intro">
      The outer border of that center is known as the black hole's event
      horizon, or "point of no return." But in April, a group of scientists from
      the international Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) Collaboration released the
      first-ever photograph of a supermassive black hole to the public. Though
      the image was fuzzy, it showed that, as predicted, black holes look like
      dark spheres surrounded by a glowing ring of light. "As a cloud of gas
      gets closer to the black hole, they speed up and heat up," Josephine
      Peters, an astrophysicist at the University of Oxford, previously told
      Business Insider. "It glows brighter the faster and hotter it gets.
      Eventually, the gas cloud gets close enough that the pull of the black
      hole stretches it into a thin arc."<br />
      <img src="bl2.webp" alt="" /> <br />
      These 2 images are very similar and its astonishing as how this was
      predicted already in the movie.Thorne told Gizmodo that "the human eye
      would likely not be able to discern the brightness differences on the two
      sides of the hole when the overall brightness is so extreme." That's why
      the film's black hole appears to have same brightness all the way around.
      <br />
